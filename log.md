# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Feb 13, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed few _JavaScript Algorithms_ of freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: Few days ago, I've completed JavaScript Algroithms from freecodecamp. Now I'm going to practice more to level my craft up. If I practice 1 Algorithms everyday, after 100 Days later, It'll be 100 Algorithms which is almost a lot. That's my current target.

**Link(s) to work**:
1. [Palindrome Checker](https://github.com/Shaonkabir/JavaScript-algorithms/blob/master/palindrome-checker.js)
2. [Factorialize a Number](https://github.com/Shaonkabir/JavaScript-algorithms/blob/master/factorize_a_number.js)
3. [Find the Longest Word in a String](https://github.com/Shaonkabir/JavaScript-algorithms/blob/master/longest-word-finder.js)
4. [Reverse a String](https://github.com/Shaonkabir/JavaScript-algorithms/blob/master/reverse-a-string.js)

### Day 2: Feb 14, Friday

**Today's Progess**: I've started learning _CSS Flexbox_ and Completed an _Algorithms_

**Thoughts**: I just watched a tutorial of @bradtraversy on Flexbox. It's awesome. I need to master on it. After that I'll learn CSS Grid and create my own CSS Framework combining Flex+Grid._I just need to create a CSS Framework to learn CSS deeply and avoid using Framework (like: Bootstrap) in a small project!_

1. [Mutation - JavaScript Algorithms](https://github.com/Shaonkabir/JavaScript-algorithms/blob/master/mutation.js)
2. [CSS Flexbox](https://github.com/Shaonkabir/learn-flex/tree/master)

### Day 3: Feb 18, Thuesday

**Today's Progess**: Solved a fontend task by entprtaher/Taher vai

**Thoughts**: I can't code for 3 days because my laptop damaged while working. I've fixed all issues already.
Today I've solved a Frontend Task where I've writen two function to prevent Click events on page and another for Events.
Check [Prevent Click Guideline](https://github.com/automatio-co/automatio-intro-tasks/blob/master/Tasks/Front_End/Front_End_Task_Prevent_Clicks.md).
I've to Refactor these coolest funcitions later for better performence.

### Day 4: Feb 19, Wednesday

**Today's Progess**: Solve _Fibonacci Number Algorithms_ and learn about Strees Testing

**Thoughts**: I've solved a Popular JavaScript Algorithms named "Fibonacci Number" as a part of #100DaysOfAlgorithm and Learned about Headless Chrome and Browser Testing (Strees Testing). I'm going to complete a JavaScript Testing Course by @kentcdodds. He is awesome teacher. There's no alternatives of Testing.
I've forked a repo for practicing JavaScript Algorithms. [Here it is!](https://github.com/Shaonkabir/awesome-algorithms)
