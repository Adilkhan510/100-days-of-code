# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Feb 13, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed few _JavaScript Algorithms_ of freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: Few days ago, I've completed JavaScript Algroithms from freecodecamp. Now I'm going to practice more to level my craft up. If I practice 1 Algorithms everyday, after 100 Days later, It'll be 100 Algorithms which is almost a lot. That's my current target.

### Day 2: Feb 14, Friday

**Today's Progess**: I've started learning _CSS Flexbox_ and Completed an _Algorithms_

**Thoughts**: I just watched a tutorial of @bradtraversy on Flexbox. It's awesome. I need to master on it. After that I'll learn CSS Grid and create my own CSS Framework combining Flex+Grid._I just need to create a CSS Framework to learn CSS deeply and avoid using Framework (like: Bootstrap) in a small project!_

### Day 3: Feb 18, Thuesday

**Today's Progess**: Solved a fontend task by entprtaher/Taher vai

**Thoughts**: I can't code for 3 days because my laptop damaged while working. I've fixed all issues already.
Today I've solved a Frontend Task where I've writen two function to prevent Click events on page and another for Events.
Check [Prevent Click Guideline](https://github.com/automatio-co/automatio-intro-tasks/blob/master/Tasks/Front_End/Front_End_Task_Prevent_Clicks.md).
I've to Refactor these coolest funcitions later for better performence.

### Day 4: Feb 19, Wednesday

**Today's Progess**: Solve _Fibonacci Number Algorithms_ and learn about Strees Testing

**Thoughts**: I've solved a Popular JavaScript Algorithms named "Fibonacci Number" as a part of #100DaysOfAlgorithm and Learned about Headless Chrome and Browser Testing (Strees Testing).
I'm going to complete a JavaScript Testing Course by @kentcdodds. He is awesome teacher. There's no alternatives of Testing.\
I've forked a repo for practicing JavaScript Algorithms. [Here it is!](https://github.com/shaonkabir8/awesome-algorithms)

### Day 4: Feb 20, Thursday

**Today's Progess**: Solve an _Algorithms_ named "Find Vowel"

**Thoughts**: I've solved a Popular JavaScript Algorithms named "Find Vowel". Basically It'll count the vowel number from a String and print it out on console.\
I just created a well commented gist to remove White Space from a String or Array. [Here](https://gist.github.com/shaonkabir8/9cdbf5116e0f45b6578d1287e11cbb28) it is.\
Finally I'm available as @shaonkabir8 on internet. Hurray!!

### Day 4: Feb 21, Friday

**Today's Progess**: start to create a super sexy projects to Find Movie [Movie Finder]

**Thoughts**: Finally, I've started building Movie Finder application using MovieDB API. It would be the best work of my React Dev Career.I'll implement many features on it.\
I've practice _Algorithms_ which i've done yet.\
It's for today. Actually I can't practice more due to 21 Feb (Internation Mother Language Day)

**Thoughts**: I've completed a Frontend Projects named "Drum Machine" of freecodecamp. I'd build exact same application with HTML,CSS,JS while learning Vanilla JavaScript through the super sexy course of @wesbos named "JavaScript30".\
Today I've re-build it with React (use SCSS instead of regular CSS) and added extra functionalities.\
Unfortunately can't practice _Algorithms_ today..
