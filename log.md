# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Feb 13, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed few _JavaScript Algorithms_ of freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: Few days ago, I've completed JavaScript Algroithms from freecodecamp. Now I'm going to practice more to level my craft up. If I practice 1 Algorithms everyday, after 100 Days later, It'll be 100 Algorithms which is almost a lot. That's my current target.

**Link(s) to work**:

2. [Factorialize a Number](https://github.com/Shaonkabir/JavaScript-algorithms/blob/master/factorize_a_number.js)
3. [Find the Longest Word in a String](https://github.com/Shaonkabir/JavaScript-algorithms/blob/master/longest-word-finder.js)
